## 🚀 Project Descriptions

### ✅ Task 1 – Decision Tree
- Utilizes **scikit-learn** for classification on the **Iris dataset**.
- Visualizes decision boundaries using tree diagrams.
- Evaluates with accuracy metrics and confusion matrix.

### ✅ Task 2 – Sentiment Analysis
- Implements NLP workflows using **TF-IDF** vectorization and **Logistic Regression**.
- Works with labeled customer reviews to classify sentiments.
- Includes thorough evaluation: accuracy, confusion matrix, and analysis via word clouds.

### ✅ Task 3 – CNN Image Classification
- Built with **TensorFlow/Keras** using the **CIFAR-10** dataset.
- Demonstrates convolutional layers, pooling, dropout, and training/validation accuracy plots.
- Covers model building and evaluation in a structured notebook.

### ✅ Task 4 – Recommendation System
- Implements **Collaborative Filtering** on a user-item ratings dataset.
- Generates top-N item recommendations using similarity metrics.
- Includes evaluation via metrics like RMSE and precision@k.
