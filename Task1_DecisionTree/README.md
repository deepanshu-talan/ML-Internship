# Task 1: Decision Tree Classifier

## Description
This task involves building and visualizing a Decision Tree model using scikit-learn on the Iris dataset. The model is trained to classify iris flowers into three species based on their features.

## Files
- `Decision_Tree_Classifier.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation, visualization, and analysis of the decision tree model.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is used, which is included in scikit-learn's datasets module and is loaded directly in the notebook using `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`. No external dataset file download is required.

## How to Run
1. Install the required Python packages if not already installed:
   ```
   pip install scikit-learn matplotlib pandas
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter notebook `Decision_Tree_Classifier.ipynb`.
3. Run the cells sequentially to train the model, evaluate it, and visualize the decision tree.

## Notes
- The notebook includes detailed comments and explanations for better understanding.
- The model achieves high accuracy on the test set.
