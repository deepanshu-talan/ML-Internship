# CNN Image Classification with TensorFlow

## Description
This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
   ```
   pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
   ```
2. Open the notebook `cnn_image_classification.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
3. Run all cells to train and evaluate the CNN.

## Dataset
CIFAR-10 is used and loaded automatically from `tensorflow.keras.datasets`.

## Output
- Final test accuracy after training
- Accuracy plots for each epoch
