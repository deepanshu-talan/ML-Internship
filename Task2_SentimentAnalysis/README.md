# Task 2: Sentiment Analysis using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression

## Description
This task involves performing sentiment analysis on a dataset of customer reviews using TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression. The model classifies reviews as positive or negative.

## Files
- `Sentiment_Analysis_Logistic_Regression.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation of the sentiment analysis model.

## Dataset
A small sample dataset of customer reviews is used within the notebook for demonstration purposes, created inline as a Python dictionary. No external dataset download is required. You can replace it with a larger dataset if desired.

## How to Run
1. Install the required Python packages if not already installed:
   ```
   pip install scikit-learn pandas matplotlib
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter notebook `Sentiment_Analysis_Logistic_Regression.ipynb`.
3. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Notes
- The notebook includes detailed comments and explanations for better understanding.
- The model achieves high accuracy on the sample test set.
